Ropsten, an Ethereum testnet launched in November 2016, has been deprecated. It served as the successor to Morden, the first proof-of-work testnet, and was identifiable by a chain and network ID of 3. Ethereum developers utilized Ropsten to test protocol upgrades and decentralized applications before deploying them on the mainnet.

The deprecation of the Ropsten testnet has rendered many applications that relied on it unusable. Among these was "Capture the Ether," a popular training platform for smart contract security.

This project is an in-progress effort to recreate a significant portion of the functionality of the original "Capture the Ether." Due to the shutdown of the Ropsten network, much of the original platform's functionality has been lost, and some features may not be brought back in this remake. This endeavor aims to provide a functional alternative for developers to continue learning about and practicing Ethereum security concepts.
